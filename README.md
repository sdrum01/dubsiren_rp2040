#Dubsiren RP2040
DUBSIREN_rp2040 is a simple Project, which was initiated to emulate a analog Tonegenerator, which is used to make some noises for Dub and Reggae.
Such Dubsirens are simple Synthesizers without VCA (Voltage Controlled Amplifier) and VCF (Voltage Controlled Filter), 
but mostly with an VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator) which is modulated by an LFO (Low Frequency Generator).

Of course, it is possible to build up the whole project with analog circuits, but the Challange was to develop the same with a digital kernal. 
Advantage is the possibility to store all parameters, simplifing the electronic and to make it hackable.

The Project is based on a cheap Raspberry Pi Pico with the fast CPU RP2040. It is fast enough to emulate VCO and LFO and has enough possibilities to store the data internally.
